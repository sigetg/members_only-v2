# Memebers_Only-v2

A simple posting app with accounts created in conjunction with the Odin Project

* Run on Ruby version 3.2.2

* Uses devise to set up user accounts, authentication and authorization

* Users can submit posts, edit and delete their own posts, and view creators of other posts only when signed in.

* Devise allows for forgotten passwords, sign in, sign out, user rememberance, and other features.

* (Its v2 because I messed up the first version)
